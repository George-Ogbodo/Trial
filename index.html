      <h3>Web developement</h3>
      <p>I have an unending zeal towards tech, I was always eager to learn a new tech skill or even meet a new tech environnment.

      <h3>Song writing</h3>
      <p>At my perusal, I always write songs, it has been a part of me since third grade. I made it a habit to write songs, getting my inspirations from people I love and cherish. My mood always determined the feeling expressed in the songs I write. It is a good thing to write songs, it enpasses all feelings at the moment, and you know what? When your are Sad or Deppressed, Just Sing.   </p>

      <h3>Basic Computer repairs</h3>
      <p>I am always inquisitive when it comes to devices, I always want to know what is behind every technology. I destroyed many of my Toys, Video games, even old Phones and wall clocks. All at the aim of knowing How it works. While growing up, I realized that it's not just about disassembling, How about assembling.</p>
